# Knowledge Check: Testing with Vite

Welcome to this knowledge check exercise! Your task is to write tests for a simple React application using Vite with Vitest.

#### Your Task

Your task is to write tests for the provided code. You need to create 4 tests:

    * Test if the Header component is rendered correctly.
    * Test if items in the list (Item component) are rendered correctly.
    * Test if the Form component works as expected or is rendered correctly.
    * Test any other functionality or edge case you think is necessary.

### Tips

    -- You don't need to do any config setup. You are receiving all the code that you need as the initial setup
    - Make sure that you create your file `filename.test.jsx` at the same level as your `app.jsx file`
    - Make sure that you're importing the components in your test file
    - Don't forget to mock necessary data if required.
    - Consider edge cases.

### Application Overview

The application is a basic to-do list where users can:

    1. See a list of items.
    2. Add new items using a form.

### Files

Here's a brief overview of the files that you are receiving:

- App.js - This is the main application file. It imports and uses other components.
- components/form.js - Contains the form to add new items.
- components/item.js - Represents each item in the list.
- components/header.js - A simple header for the application.
- app.css - Contains styles for the application.
